# Overview

An example of mapping a data array using `_.slice` and `_.map` from `LoDash` which is included on Framer X by default. On the code sample you will see how to import the functions you will need instead of the whole `lodash` library, which is a good practice for writing clean components.

# Usage

Create a new code component with the name MapData and paste the code on `MapData.tsx`.
